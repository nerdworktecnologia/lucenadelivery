# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables (Supabase)

Create a `.env` file at the project root (you can start from `.env.example`) with:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` (optional, but recommended to prevent pointing to the wrong project)

## Signup error: "Database error saving new user"

If you see this error on account creation, it is almost always caused by a broken `auth.users` trigger that tries to insert into `public.profiles` with the wrong columns/constraints.

This repo includes an idempotent migration that fixes the `public.handle_new_user()` function and recreates the `on_auth_user_created` trigger:

- `supabase/migrations/20260511153000_7d2f4a1d-58bf-4c3c-b2bd-7a8c3c6d3db6.sql`

Apply the latest migrations to your Supabase project (via Supabase CLI or the SQL editor) and try signing up again.

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
